Hi. I'm John Wilson
Been programming in Excel VBA for as long as I can remember.
My 1st intro to spreadsheets was MultiPlan on my C64, gaduated to VisiCalc, QuatroPro, Lotus (I really liked Lotus) and finally Excel.
Still working part time creating user friendly Excel programs and doing some web scraping here and there.
Held on as long as I could to scraping with IE but MS is making that more difficult every chance they get.
Looking to learn Selenium for Chrome and create some scraping programs that will last a while.
